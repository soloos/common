// The result of Read is an array of bytes, but for performance
// reasons, we can also return data as a file-descriptor/offset/size
// tuple.  If the backing store for a file is another filesystem, this
// reduces the amount of copying between the kernel and the FUSE
// server.  The ReadResult interface captures both cases.
type ReadResult interface {
	// Returns the raw bytes for the read, possibly using the
	// passed buffer. The buffer should be larger than the return
	// value from Size.
	Bytes(buf []byte) ([]byte, Status)

	// Size returns how many bytes this return value takes at most.
	Size() int

	// Done() is called after sending the data to the kernel.
